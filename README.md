## What's this?
This is an unofficial web app for the game Splatoon 3 that alerts you about relevant SplatNet gear. It's currently work-in-progress, but you can view updates on my [Twitter (@ShrimpCryptid)](https://twitter.com/shrimpcryptid) and via the roadmap below, which I'll update as I make progress.

It's made using NEXT.js, which is a framework for React and Node.js, and the database is built on PostgresSQL.

I'm currently targeting December 2022 for launch. ðŸ¤ž
