## What's this?
Splatoon 3 comes with a companion app, SplatNet 3, which has its own shop and a daily rotating inventory. These items have unique ability combinations that you can't normally buy, but checking the app daily is a bit of a pain.

This is an unofficial web app for the game Splatoon 3 that alerts you about SplatNet gear you're interested in! You can view updates on my [Twitter (@ShrimpCryptid)](https://twitter.com/shrimpcryptid) and via the roadmap below, which I'll update as I make progress.

It's made using NEXT.js, which is a framework for React and Node.js, and the database is built on PostgreSQL.

## Features
- Filter by any combination of gear item, type (hats, clothing, shoes), ability, and brand.
- Receive push notifications on your devices when those items come into the shop!
- Data is synced across devices, no passwords required.
